# Test Folder for VAS File Architect

This folder contains sample images and subfolders with images to demonstrate and test the functionality of the VAS File Architect tool. These images are structured to mimic a realistic use case scenario.

## Contents

- `marioparty.png`: A sample image at the root of the test folder.
- `final/`: A subfolder containing two images (`final1.png` and `final2.png`).
- `split/`: A subfolder containing four images (`Box.png`, `Key.png`, `Necklace.png`, and `Ring.png`).

Each of these images is intended to showcase the tool's ability to process individual images in the main directory and any subdirectories.

## Usage

To use these test images:

1. Copy the `test-folder` to your chosen directory.
2. Run the VAS File Architect tool and select this copied `test-folder` as your target directory.
3. Observe how the tool processes these images, generates XML and ASL files, and compiles them into a VAS archive.

These images are for testing purposes and are arbitrarily chosen to represent various scenarios in video auto splitting.
